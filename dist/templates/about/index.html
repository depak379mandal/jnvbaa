                    Welcome to JNV Betul Alumni Association. We aim to provide a lifelong connection between the alumni and students of JNV Betul. It is a platform for interaction and expression for the various members of JNV Betul.

                    JNV Betul is situated near a small village called Prabhat Pattan in the Betul district of Madhya Pradesh. Prabhat Pattan, though a small village is known for its freedom fighters. Like all other JNVs across India, JNV Prabhat Pattan has been more than a school and home for many students, majority from the rural areas of Betul district since its inception in 1993. It has shaped the careers of many students who are at many important places in both government and private sectors now. In collaboration with extremely dedicated volunteers, we seek to connect alumni, support students and build an unforgettable experience through diverse events, programs and service.

                    On 25th December 2016 Alumni day was held at JNV Betul and on that occasion it was felt that there should be a well organized alumni association for the school which should work towards development of school and students. Starting with this in mind a preliminary visit to school and meeting with school management was done on 29th January 2017 and it was decided to form JNV Betul Alumni Association. An Alumni Body was already existing which was formed by the first batch of the school, adding to it only, officially JNV Betul Alumni Association was formed on 21 May 2017 in concurrence with our school foundation day i.e. 21 may 1993.
